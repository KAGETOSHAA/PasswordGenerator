# PasswordGenerator
Hi. This is a simple password generator with the ability 
to choose which characters will be used. Here's how to use it:

At first, you will be asked to choose which characters will be used, 
there are 4 categories. You can write them together, separately, as you wish. 
After that, they ask for the desired password length, and then the generation begins.

Thank you for your attention
